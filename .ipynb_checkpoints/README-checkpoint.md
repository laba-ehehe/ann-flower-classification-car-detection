## About The Project

This project implements neural networks for two distinct tasks:
1. A flower species classifier trained on 1678 images across 10 different flower species
2. A car detection model that predicts bounding box coordinates for cars in satellite imagery

The project explores various neural network architectures, hyperparameter tuning, and implementation of best practices such as early stopping and adaptive learning rates.
